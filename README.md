# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to observe the effect of different variables, in particular the Launch Date and the Goal, and their impact on the outcomes of various theatre projects based on data compiled from 2009 to 2019 from various theatre productions worldwide

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To see the relationship between launch date of various theatre projects affect their outcome we have modeled the data in the graph below:

</p>

With the month of the year on the x-axis and number of productions on the y-axis, our graph is comprised of theatre projects from various countries around the world from 2009-2017
Initially looking at the graph we can see that regardless of launch date the number of successful plays is greater than the number of cancelled plays and the number of failed plays. 
We see an upwards trend in the success of plays from Jan to May - with the success of plays reaching an overall high of 111. After this spike in May we see a downwards trend in the success of plays for the rest of the year, almost equalling the number of failed plays in December. 
There is a very slight upwards trend in the number of failed plays from January to May where it is somewhat stable until September, where the number of failed plays begins to fluctuate slightly.
We can also note that from the graph we see that the number of cancelled plays is consistent and does not show any indication that launch date has much affect. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To see the relationship between the goals set by plays and their overall outcome we have modeled the data in the graph below: 

<p align="center">
<img src = https://github.com/smanowar/-kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/outcomes_vs_goals.png>
</p>

With the range of the goal set on the x-axis and the percentage of the outcome on the y-axis, our graph is comprised of plays from various countries around the world from 2009-2017.
It is important to note that our data showed there were no plays cancelled - see yellow line on graph, so our analysis will focus only on successful plays and failed plays.
Based on the graph we can see that the percentage of successful plays fluctuates based on the goal. Less than $1000 we see the success rate of plays at a high of 80%, which gradually begins to drop until the range of $25000 to $29999. It then spikes back up between the range of $35000 to $44999 and then drops significantly in the range of $45000 to $50000 at a success rate of 0%.
As the success rate fluctuates, the percentage failed must as well. We see that with goals less than $1000, the percentage of failed productions is only 25%, which gradually begins to increase to 80% in the range of $25000 to $29999. The percentage of failed productions then begins to drop to 34% in the range of $35000 to $44999 and spikes to 100% for goals in the range of $45000 to $50000.

## Results

***What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?***

Based on the graph we can see that plays gain popularity at the beginning of the year and loses interest after May. We can see that May produces the largest number of successful plays. May also has the largest number of plays taking place overall, with a value of 166. 
We can also see that December has the least number of successful theatre productions and the least number of theatre productions overall with a total of only 75 productions taking place. Also, the number of successful plays is almost equal to the number of failed plays in December.
As May has the largest number of theatre productions overall the number of successful productions spikes in May. As the larger number of productions launched in May allows for a larger number of successful productions, we would also expect the number of failed to increase as well. However, we can see from the graph that the increase in failed productions in May is much less than the spike in successful productions. Based on these findings we can conclude that the best time to launch a theatre production is in May, and the worst time to launch in December.

***What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?***

Based on the graph we can conclude that there is no distinct relationship between Outcomes and Goals of the plays. There is a significant distinction in the percentage of successful plays and percentage of failed plays with goals under $4999, with a total number of productions overall in this range totaling to 720. We see this pattern once again in the range of $35000 to $44999, however, the number of productions overall in this range totals to only 9 – giving each production in this range a greater weight affecting the outcome.
We can conclude that the plays have a much higher chance of being successful if they set a goal equal to or less than $4999. 

***What are some limitations of this dataset?***

Our graphs limit our ability to detect if any outliers exist – the impact of which would skew the results of our graph. For instance, the line graph used to model the outcomes based on launch date are comprised of many years data. There may be confounding variables affecting the popularity of plays year by year that should be noted - amount of disposable income for individuals that year for example. 

***What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?***

Other possible tables that could provided additional insight would be a bar graph to show if there are any trends on the success, failed, and cancelled based on year.
A graph that models the country in which Louise wishes to launch her production would also provide better insight to her as the graph models data from a variety of different countries.
